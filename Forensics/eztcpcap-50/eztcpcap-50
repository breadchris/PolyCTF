===Question==
Nextgenhacker101 has been up to more shennanigans. Shorty after exploiting a tracer-t vulnerability on the pentagon, NGH101 was spotted entering a coffee shop with a laptop. Since the traffic in the coffe shop was unencrypted, we managed to get a pcap of his session. Help us find out what hes been up to.
